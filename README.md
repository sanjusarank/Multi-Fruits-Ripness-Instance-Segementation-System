# Multi-Fruit Ripeness Instance Segmentation System

## Project Overview
The **Multi-Fruit Ripeness Instance Segmentation System** is a computer vision project designed to identify and classify the ripeness stages of six fruits:  
- **Orange**  
- **Pomegranate**  
- **Banana**  
- **Mango**  
- **Lemon**  
- **Papaya**  

Each fruit is annotated with 3-4 ripeness stages and trained using the **YOLOv8l-seg.pt model**, achieving an accuracy of over **90%** for each fruit. The system supports:  
1. **Image Upload**  
2. **Video Upload**  
3. **Real-time Detection** using a webcam.  

The application is built with **Streamlit**, providing an intuitive user interface for predictions. It displays original and annotated (predicted) outputs side-by-side.
